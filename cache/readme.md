# usage of the Cache-Folder

this Folder is meant to store the cached Output of the Documentation-System. The File-Names represent the MD5ed File-String and contain the whole HTML-Source, generated by the Documentation-System.

## Activation

* on Unix-Servers make sure this Folder is writable.
* in **showDoc.php** uncomment two commented Parts (responsible for checking and writing the Caches)


if activated, and detecting a Cacheed Version, the System will ignore the Source-Files and will load the Cache instead. If you want to change some Documents you have to clear the Cache calling clear.php.
